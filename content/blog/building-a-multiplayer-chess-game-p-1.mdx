# [Introduction - Game On!](#introduction)

I've been playing chess for a while now, and I've always been fascinated by the
game. I love the strategy and the tactics, and I'm always looking for new ways
to improve my game. In my latest attempt to combine programming with other
aspects of my life, I decided to build my own online multiplayer chess game from
scratch â€” in a week.

I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can build a full scale web application
(frontend + backend with real time) in a week while juggling a plethora of other
things.

# [The Plan](#the-plan)

The plan is to build a system that allows two players to play chess against each
other via challenge links. I want to keep it simple, so here are the core
features of the game will be:

## 1. Real Time Gameplay: The game will be played in real time, with the players taking turns to move their pieces.

    <Spacer />

## 2. Challenge Links: Players will be able to create challenge links that allow them to play against each other.

    <Spacer />

## 3. Rating System: Players will be rated based on how well they play, using the ELO rating system.

    <Spacer />

## 4. Authentication: Users should be able to create an account and log in on a wide range of platforms.

    <Spacer />

## 5. LeaderBoard: Players will be able to see their ranking on the leaderboard based on their win rate.

    <Spacer />

## 6. Analytics: Simple visualizations of players' win-loss ratios, ELO rating and challenges played.

# [Tech Stack](#tech-stack)

## 1. Frontend: NextJS w/ Typescript, tailwindCSS, Sockets io

    <Spacer />

## 2. Backend: ExpressJS w/ Typescript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Sockets io

    <Spacer />

## 3. Deployment: Docker, Digital Ocean (or Render).

    <Spacer />

## 4. Development Time: 1 week.

# [Progress so far](#progress-so-far)

So far, I've written out the specifications and some basic system architecture.
I also designed the logo and a few other screens for the game.

the right." />

I'm currently designing the web UI and plan to start the backend on Sunday (Oct.
6th).

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

That about wraps up the plan for the project. I'm excited to see where this
goes. I'll try to document my progress, probably every 2 - 3 days since writing
the chess game and this blog at the same time would be overkill lol. See you in
the next post!
