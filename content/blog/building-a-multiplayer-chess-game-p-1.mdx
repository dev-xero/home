# [Introduction - Game On!](#introduction)

I've been playing chess for a while now, and I've always been fascinated by the
game. I love the strategy and the tactics, and I'm always looking for new ways
to improve my game. One of the things that I find most interesting about chess
is the way it can be played with friends. It's a great way to bond over a shared
activity and to learn from each other.
