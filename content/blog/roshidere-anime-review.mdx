# [A Russian Tsundere!](#a-russian-tsundere)

**_As of this writing, the anime is still airing at episode 7/12, there will be mild spoilers._**

**Roshidere** or **“Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian”** introduces us to Alya, a Russian girl who embodies the classic “tsundere” archetype — a character trope that oscillates between coldness and affection, often hiding her true feelings behind a veil of sarcasm and cute aloofness.

The interactions with her classmate Masachika, forms the crux of the series, sometimes seemingly one-sided, the relationship both entertaining and endearing to watch.

At first glance, this anime checks off your standard rom-com starter pack: the cute "perfect" love interest who excels at everything, and then the laid-back, unmotivated protagonist who _somehow_ captures her attention. The premise is familiar, but it's in the execution and the unique cultural twist that the show sets itself apart.

# [Good Story Telling is Hard](#good-story-telling-is-hard)

I'll admit, I'm not typically a fan of rom-com anime — most often, they fall flat with uninspired storytelling, shallow characters, and the most basic, cookie-cutter plots. The same can be said for most Isekai. However, I do appreciate when a series manages to break the mold, delivering a story where the writing is sharp and the characters leave a solid, lasting impression.

Achieving this balance isn't easy. A few standout series that successfully raised the bar for shounen rom-coms in recent years include Kaguya-sama: Love is War, The Quintessential Quintuplets, Hyouka and Horimiya, to name a few.

I decided to give this anime a try after catching their trailer on YouTube, interested in the fact that it's produced by Studio Doga Kobo — the same studio behind the wildly successful* **Oshi no Ko** and another recent favorite of mine, **Jellyfish Can't Swim in the Night**.

# [First Impressions](#first-impressions)

    context="Our main protagonist: Alya"
/>

Initially, I didn't expect much from this anime. In fact, I found Alya somewhat unlikable at first due to her cold and mostly irrational behavior. However, as the episodes progressed, I started enjoying more and more of it. The main highlight of the series is Alya's habit of blurting out affectionate (and occasionally cringe-worthy) phrases in Russian about Masachika, all while being blissfully unaware that he understands every word. And when he does (jokingly) ask for a translation, she brushes it off by claiming she was insulting him or saying something else entirely. It'll be really funny when she realizes he understands every cringe sentence she utters lol.

The Russian isn't bad either, for an anime of this budget. The show is filled with funny, quirky characters. Not long after we meet Alya, we're introduced to another seemingly "perfect" girl, Suou, a fellow student council member who also appears to have an interest in Masachika (seriously, what do they see in these protags?).

However, this impression is quickly subverted when it's revealed that Suou is actually Masachika's younger sister. Her prim and proper facade hides her true nature — a tomboyish, immature, hardcore otaku who often says and does things like the protagonist of her own anime (Chuunibyou anime reference?).

Suou is one of my favorite characters in the series, because she's interestingly written, and also because she's hilarious to watch, I've laughed a few times watching her cringy weeb antics.

A significant plot point in the series is Suou's intention to run for student council president (classic), with Alya also vying for the position. I'm interested to see how the story will unfold, especially after some slightly unnerving details about Masachika's and Suou's past that were revealed in episode 7 last week.

Most of the other characters are barely interesting enough, with a few exceptions like Taniyama and Kujo-senpai.

# [The Next Big Rom-Com?](#the-next-big-rom-com)

Based on what I've seen so far, this anime certainly outshines many of the hundreds of rom-coms attempting the same formula. But, calling it the “next big rom-com” would be an overstatement at this point. The story is entertaining, offering more depth than your typical rom-com that often require less than half a braincell to enjoy.

# [Closing Thoughts](#closing-thoughts)

Overall, the series is a refreshing take on a repetitive genre, managing to stand out with its unique characters and amusing plot dynamics. If you're looking for a rom-com that offers more than just the typical tropes and mixes humor with heartfelt moments, this one is worth a watch. I'm curious to see where the story goes. Whether it becomes the next big thing or simply another memorable series, it's already left a good impression on me.
