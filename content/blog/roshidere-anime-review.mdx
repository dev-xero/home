# [A Russian Tsundere](#a-russian-tsundere)

**_As of this writing, the anime is still airing at episode 7/12, there will be mild spoilers._**

**Roshidere** or **“Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian”** introduces us to Alya, a Russian girl who embodies the classic “tsundere” archetype — a character trope that oscillates between coldness and affection, often hiding her true feelings behind a veil of sarcasm and aloofness.

The dynamic with her classmate Masachika forms the crux of the series, with her seemingly one-sided interactions, making the relationship both entertaining and endearing.

At first glance, this anime checks off the standard rom-com starter pack: the "perfect" love interest who excels at everything and the laid-back, unmotivated protagonist who _somehow_ captures her attention. While the premise is familiar, it's in the execution and the unique cultural twist that the show sets itself apart.

# [Good Story Telling is Hard](#good-story-telling-is-hard)

I'll admit, I'm not typically a fan of rom-com anime — too often, they fall flat with uninspired storytelling, shallow characters, and the most basic, cookie-cutter plots. The same can be said for many Isekai series. However, I do appreciate when a series manages to break the mold, delivering a story where the writing is sharp and the characters leave a solid, lasting impression.

Achieving this balance is no small feat. A few standout series that successfully raised the bar for shounen rom-coms in recent years include Kaguya-sama: Love is War, The Quintessential Quintuplets, Hyouka and Horimiya, to name a few.

I decided to watch this anime after catching the trailer on YouTube, intrigued by the fact that it's from Studio Doga Kobo — the same studio behind the wildly successful **Oshi no Ko** and another recent favorite of mine, **Jellyfish Can't Swim in the Night**.

Initially, I didn't expect much from this anime. In fact, I found Alya somewhat unlikable at first due to her cold and mostly irrational behavior. However, as the episodes progressed, I found myself enjoying it more and more. The true highlight of the series is Alya's habit of blurting out affectionate (and occasionally cringe-worthy) phrases in Russian about Masachika, all while being blissfully unaware that he understands every word. When he jokingly confronts her, she brushes it off, teasing him by claiming she was insulting him or saying something else entirely. It'll be really hilarious when she realizes tho.

The Russian is also solid, for an anime with this budget. The real strength of this series lies in its entertaining and quirky characters. Not long after we meet Alya, we're introduced to another seemingly "perfect" girl, Suou, a fellow student council member who also appears to have an interest in Masachika (seriously, what do they see in these protags?).

However, this impression is quickly subverted when it's revealed that Suou is actually Masachika's younger sister. Her prim and proper facade hides her true nature — a tomboyish, immature, hardcore otaku who often says and does things as if she were the protagonist of her own anime (Chuunibyou ani reference?).

Suou is one of my favorite characters in the series, not just because she's well-written, but also because she's always fun to watch, I've laughed a few times watching her cringy chuunibyou antics. She not only teases Masachika endlessly but Alya as well, who she views as her main rival.

A significant plot point in the series is Suou's intention to run for student council president (admittedly, a trope that's been overused), with Alya also vying for the position. I'm interested to see how the story will unfold, after some slightly unnerving details about Masachika's and Suou's past that were revealed in episode 7, last week Wednesday.

Most of the other characters are barely interesting enough, but with a few exceptions like Taniyama and Kujo-senpai.

# [The Next Big Rom-Com?](#the-next-big-rom-com)

Based on what I've seen so far, this anime certainly outshines many of the hundreds of rom-coms attempting the same formula. However, calling it the “next big rom-com” would be an overstatement at this point. The story is entertaining and engaging, offering more depth than your typical rom-com that often require less than one braincell to enjoy.

# [Closing Thoughts](#closing-thoughts)

Overall, Roshidere or "Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian" is a refreshing take on the rom-com genre, managing to stand out in a crowded field with its unique characters and amusing plot dynamics. If you're looking for a rom-com that offers more than just the typical tropes and isn't afraid to mix humor with heartfelt moments, this one is worth a watch. I'm curious to see where the story goes, whether it becomes the next big thing or simply a memorable series, it's already left a good impression on me.
