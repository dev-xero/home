# [A Russian Tsundere](#a-russian-tsundere)

**_As of this writing, the anime is still airing at episode 7/12, there will be mild spoilers._**

**Roshidere** or **“Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian”** introduces us to Alya, a Russian girl who embodies the quintessential “tsundere” archetype — a character trope that oscillates between coldness and warmth, often hiding her true feelings behind a veil of sarcasm and aloofness.

The dynamic with her classmate Masachika forms the crux of the series, with her seemingly one-sided interactions, making the relationship both entertaining and endearing.

At first glance, this anime checks off all the standard rom-com starter pack: the "perfect" love interest who excels in everything and the laid-back, unmotivated protagonist who _somehow_ captures her attention. While the premise may seem familiar, it's in the execution and the unique cultural twist that the show sets itself apart.

# [Good Story Telling is Hard](#good-story-telling-is-hard)

I'll admit, I'm not typically a fan of rom-com anime—too often, they fall flat with uninspired storytelling, shallow characters, and formulaic plots. The same can be said for many Isekai series. However, I do appreciate when a mangaka manages to break the mold, delivering a story where the writing is sharp and the characters leave a lasting impression.

Achieving this balance is no small feat. A few standout series that have successfully raised the bar for shounen rom-coms in recent years include Kaguya-sama: Love is War, The Quintessential Quintuplets, and Horimiya.

I decided to watch this anime after catching the trailer on YouTube, intrigued by the fact that it's from Studio Doga Kobo — the same studio behind the wildly successful **Oshi no Ko** and another recent favorite of mine, **Jellyfish Can't Swim in the Night**.

Initially, I didn't expect much from this anime. In fact, I found Alya somewhat unlikable at first due to her cold and mostly irrational behavior. However, as the episodes progressed, I found myself enjoying it more and more. The true highlight of the series is Alya's habit of blurting out affectionate (and occasionally cringe-worthy) phrases in Russian about Masachika, all while being blissfully unaware that he understands every word. When he jokingly confronts her, she brushes it off, teasing him by claiming she was insulting him or saying something else entirely.

The real strength of this series lies in its entertaining and unique characters. Not long after we meet Alya, we're introduced to another seemingly "perfect" girl, Suou, a fellow student council member who also appears to have an interest in Masachika (seriously, what do they see in these protagonists?).

However, this impression is quickly subverted when it's revealed that Suou is actually Masachika's younger sister. Her prim and proper facade hides her true nature — a tomboyish, hardcore otaku who often says and does things as if she were the protagonist of her own anime.

Suou is one of my favorite characters in the series, not just because she's well-written, but because she never fails to bring a smile to your face (albeit through some cringeworthy antics). She not only teases Masachika endlessly but Alya too.
