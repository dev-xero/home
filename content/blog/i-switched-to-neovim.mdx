# [To Vim or Not to Vim](#to-vim-or-not-to-vim)

Alas, after lots frustrations with VS Code, I've finally decided to switch to Neovim (at least for now). You might be wondering what a "Neovim" is. For the uninitiated:

> Neovim is an terminal-based, light-weight, code editor engineered for speed and versatility. 

Which basically means you write code straight from your terminal, instead of using some proprietary, resource-intensive, electron-based bloatware (aka VS Code).

I've ignored Neovim for a while, mostly because I was fine with what VSCode had to offer. But lately, the devs have been cluttering up the software with more and more useless bloat each passing update, and coding starts to get pretty sloppy the longer you spend on it.

So a week ago, I decided to try Neovim, and boy _is it fast!_ (I'm writing this blog in Neovim). Opening up projects just takes a matter of milliseconds! Since it all runs in the terminal, it's also very memory efficient (VS Code uses about 1.5GB on average while Neovim uses just 10MB! More RAM for my 100+ edge tabs yay).

In Vim (and Neovim), you navigate using your home row keys (h, j, k and l), in what's called "Normal" mode and insert text/code using "i" (insert mode). Now that might sound crazy, especially if you've never done it before. You might be wondering: why do I need to switch between modes to move and insert text? I just want to write code agghhh. Well dear reader, Neovim's philosophy is simple: 

> you don't need to leave your keyboard, 90% of your coding should be done without ever leaving it. 

Think about it, how many precious seconds have _you_ wasted, moving your hand to reach for your mouse, moving the cursor around all haphazardly (perhaps with a few misclicks along the way) and then spawning back to your keyboard to continue coding? (_I promise I'm not just trolling at this point lol._)

A lot of people, especially beginners, turn away from Neovim because of the keybindings (Vim Motions&trade;) and due to the fact that you need to pretty much configure everything yourself before you can enjoy the perks of modern day bloatware like VS Code.

Neovim is insanely customizable, you could customize the life out of it. And some folks certainly configure everything (I mean _everything_) from the ground up (the kind of guys you find using Arch Linux, btw). But I found that to be a bit too extreme, I just wanted to spin something up and get grinding.

There's quite a few popular Neovim "distros" that come pre-packaged with just enough plugins for you do develop almost instantly. Some worth mentioning are LunarVim, LazyVim and [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/), which is what I ended up using. Seriously, it comes with a lot of good stuff, I didn't even need to do much customizing.
